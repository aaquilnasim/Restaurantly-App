I have used Java and spring framework for the backend part of Restaurant application
and used Angular in frontend.
Added features:
1. Home page from where we can go to list of dishes and search for particular dishes as well as sort with respect to Menu, Categories and Dishes.
2. About Section
3. Gallery
4. Contact Us section
5. Admin Section where admin can login by providing email ID and password in order to manage menus,categories and dishes.

After login admin can see three dashboard buttons to manage.
CRUD operation is performed and with respect to that menu, categories and dishes.

Inorder to run the Restaurant application one has to create the database and insert the datas in tables in mySQL as well provide link,username and password in application.properties.
